This directory contains ESRI shapefiles that originated in the
ESRI Data and Maps 1999, 2000, 2002 CD-ROM data set. Each shape
file (.shp) has an associated database (.dbx) and index (.shx).
Some files also have an associated metainformation file (.xml).
The files are:

canadaprovince -- Canadian province boundaries
cntry02        -- High-resolution country boundaries as of 2002
continents     -- Continental boundaries
country        -- Low-resolution country boundaries as of 2002
lakes          -- Lakes (worldwide)
rivers         -- Rivers (worldwide)
states         -- U.S. State boundaries

The date of creation and the scale used vary with the data set 
selected, and is detailed in the file's associated .xml file,
if one is present. Additional data from ESRI's World Basemap
Service is available from:
