                 maps
------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a number of subdirectories, each
of which contains map data used by IDL. The subdirectories
are:

  - low
    Low-resolution map world map data. This directory and
    its contents are installed by default.

  - high
    High-resolution map data from the CIA World Map Database.
    This directory and its contents are only installed if you
    specify the High Resolution Maps option when installing
    IDL.

  - shape
    ESRI shapefiles containing continental and political
    boundaries, as well as geographic features (lakes and
    rivers). These freely-redistibutable shapefiles are
    based on data available from the ESRI ArcWeb Services
    World Basemap Service.
