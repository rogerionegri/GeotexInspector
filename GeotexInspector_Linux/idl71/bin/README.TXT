------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a number of shell scripts used by
IDL. Binary files specific to your platform are located in
the bin.<platform> subdirectory of this directory. (For
example, on a Sun computer running the Solaris operating
system, the binary files are located in the bin.solaris2.sparc
directory.)

You should not need to alter any of the scripts in this
directory.
